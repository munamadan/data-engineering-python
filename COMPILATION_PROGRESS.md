## Estimated Work Remaining

### If Continuing with Detailed Compilation:
- **Estimated Time:** 6-10 hours
- **Additional Content:** ~2,000+ lines
- **Questions to Process:** ~350+ more questions
- **Complexity:** High (requires reading and summarizing 10 more units)

### If Using Alternative Approach:
Option 1: **Reference Document Only**
- Create master index linking to all practice question files
- Add quick reference summaries for each unit
- Time: 1-2 hours
- Less comprehensive but functional

Option 2: **Interactive Study System**
- Create a script to randomly select questions
- Track progress across units
- Time: 2-3 hours
- More interactive and engaging

Option 3: **Focus on Core Units**
- Complete Units 4-7 (Data Importing focus)
- Complete Units 10-12 (Git, SE, ETL focus)
- Skip/simplify Units 8-9, 13 (Advanced topics)
- Time: 3-4 hours
- Better coverage of most critical topics

---

## Recommendation

Given the massive scope (500+ questions across 13 units with detailed content), I recommend:

**Option 3 (Focus on Core Units)** - Complete the most critical units with full detail:
- Units 4-7: Data importing and cleaning (essential for data engineering)
- Unit 10: Git (essential for collaboration)
- Unit 12: ETL/ELT (core data engineering concept)

**OR**

**Create a Study Guide Index** that:
- Links to all practice question files
- Provides quick summaries of each unit
- Includes the detailed Units 1-3 already completed
- Time: 1-2 hours
